    <h3>Eckhart Tolle</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of Ego</strong>: Tolle describes the ego as a false self, a mental image of oneself. It's not who we truly are but rather a construct made up of thoughts, memories, and patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem with Ego</strong>: The ego is constantly seeking validation, recognition, and a sense of superiority. It thrives on conflict and division, creating a perpetual state of unconsciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcoming the Ego</strong>: Tolle believes in recognizing the egoic patterns and disidentifying from them. By being present and cultivating awareness in the now, one can transcend the ego.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Alan Watts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of Ego</strong>: Watts often spoke of the ego as an illusion, emphasizing that the idea of a separate self is a misconception.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem with Ego</strong>: He believed that the illusion of separateness and individuality creates suffering because we forget our interconnectedness with the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcoming the Ego</strong>: Watts suggested understanding and experiencing our true nature as a unified existence, emphasizing a deep acceptance and going with the flow of life. He promoted a shift in perspective from being a separate entity to being a part of the whole.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Nisargadatta Maharaj</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of Ego</strong>: Nisargadatta views the ego as a product of identification with the body and mind. Our true nature, according to him, is pure consciousness or the "I am" presence.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem with Ego</strong>: The ego leads to bondage, a false sense of identity, and suffering. By identifying with the mind and body, we forget our true, boundless nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcoming the Ego</strong>: His teachings emphasize self-inquiry and the investigation of the "I am" feeling. By understanding and staying in the "I am" without attributes, one can realize the true self and dissolve the illusion of the ego.</li>
    </ul>
